Shifu is a [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io) native framework designed to abstract out the complexity of interacting with IoT devices. Shifu aims to achieve TRUE plug'n'play IoT device virtualization, management, control and automation.

## Why use Shifu?

- Shifu let you manage and control your IoT device extremely easily through ***deviceShifu***, a digital twin for your device.
- ***deviceShifu*** provides you with a high-level abstraction to interact with your device. By implementing the interface of the ***deviceShifu***, your IoT device can achieve everything its designed for, and much more! For example, you can have your device actively push its telemetries to any endpoint of your choice.

## How to use Shifu?
Please refer to [shifu doc](https://shifu.run/docs/).

### Demo:
We have prepared a demo for developers to intuitively show how `Shifu` is able to create and manage digital twins of any physical devices in real world.
- [Shifu Demo](https://demo.shifu.run/)

# Our Roadmap
## Features
### Supported
- Telemetry collection: shifu supports periodic collection of any telemetries from device. What telemetries to collect, how to collect, how frequent is the collection are all customizable in one single configuration file.
- Integration with Kubernetes with CRD: shifu allows any types or forms of configurations for your devices.
### Not yet supported
- Auto ***deviceShifu*** generation
- [Declarative API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#declarative-apis)
- [Advanced Shifu Controller](docs/design/design-shifuController.md)
- [shifud](docs/design/design-shifud.md)
- Abstraction:
  - Horizontal
  - Vertical
- Simulation

# Shifu's vision

## Make developers and operators happy again

Developers and operators should 100% focus on using their creativity to make huge impacts, not fixing infrastructures and re-inventing the wheels day in and day out. As a developer and an operator, Shifu knows your pain!!! Shifu wants to take out all the underlying mess, and make us developers and operators happy again!

## Software Defined World (SDW)

If every IoT device has a Shifu with it, we can leverage software to manage our surroundings, and make the whole world software defined. In a SDW, everything is intelligent, and the world around you will automatically change itself to serve your needs. After all, all the technology we built are designed to serve human beings.
