# Shifu

## What is Shifu?

Shifu is a framework designed to abstract out the complexity of interacting with IoT devices. Shifu aims to achieve TRUE plug'n'play IoT device management.

## Why use Shifu?

Shifu let you manage and control your IoT devices extremely easily. Whenever you connect your device, Shifu will recognize it and spawn an augmented digital twin called ***deviceShifu*** for it. deviceShifu provides you with a high-level abstraction to interact with your device. By implementing the interface of the deviceShifu, your IoT device can achieve everything its designed for, and much more! For example, your device's state can be rolled back with a single line of command. (If physically permitted, of course.) Furthermore, Shifu will secure your entire IoT system from ground up. 

## How to use Shifu?

Currently, Shifu runs on [Kubernetes](k8s.io). We will provide more deployment methods including standalone deployment in the future.

# Shifu's vision

## Make developers and operators happy again

Developers and operators should 100% focus on using their creativity to make huge impacts, not fixing infrastructures and re-inventing the wheels day in and day out. As a developer and an operator, Shifu knows your pain!!! Shifu wants to take out all the underlying mess, and make us developers and operators happy again!

## Software Defined World (SDW)

If every IoT device has a Shifu with it, we can leverage software to manage our surroundings, and make the whole world software defined. In a SDW, everything is intelligent, and the world around you will automatically change itself to serve your needs. After all, all the technology we built are designed to serve human beings.
