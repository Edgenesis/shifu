# TelemetryService Refactor

## What is TelemetrySerice

***deviceShifu*** Telemetry is part of the ***deviceShifu*** [Compute](https://github.com/Edgenesis/shifu/blob/main/docs/design/design-deviceShifu.md#compute) plugin. It periodically pulls device instructions defined in the telemetries section in ***deviceShifu*** ConfigMap.

The result for each telemetry should update `EdgeDevice`'s status accordingly.

## Why need to refactor TelemetryService?

- Currently, telemetryServices' connection settings are read by deviceShifu, which will send all connection settings to telemetryService, so telemetryService strongly depends on deviceShifu.
- telemetryService's connection settings may include some private information, such as secrets read from deviceShifu, so that deviceShifu will have more access to read this information from the kubernetes API, which is a bad RBAC practice.
- The installation yaml file of Shifu needs to be separate from the yaml file of telemetryService.
- telemetryService pushes to HTTP endpoints differently than other protocols, which makes it difficult to use.

### Design Goals

- The yaml for deploying telemetryService will be compatible with older versions.
- Modify the code in deviceShifu about telemetryService, such as `pushToHTTPTelemetryCollectionService` to telemetryService.
- Let telemetryService get the connection settings from the Kubernetes API. deviceShifu only needs to send the telemetryService's name and raw data to telemetryService.
- Developers developing a new endpoint only need to update the telemetryService.

### Non-Goal

- Adding a new protocol to a telemetry service
- Update the YAML file for deploying telemetryService

## Detail Design

We can use Kubernetes dynamicClient to observe the changes in CRD and update the connection settings in time use a goruntine. First, we need to initialize and get all telemetry services from Kubernetes. Then use a sync.Map to restore the TelemetryService Connection Settings 
```go
var dynamicClient 
func init () {
config, err := rest.InClusterConfig()
clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)
dynamicClient = dynamic.NewForConfigOrDie(config)
tss := dynamicClient.Resource().List()
// ... store telemetryServices into tsMap
}

watcher, err := dynamicClient.Resource(&schema.GroupVersionResource{
    Group:    "shifu.edgenesis.io",
    Version:  "v1alpha1",
    Resource: "TelemetryService",
}).Watch(context.Background(), metav1.ListOptions{})
for event := range watcher.ResultChan() {
    switch event.Type {
        case watch.Added:
            fallthrough
        case watch.Modified:
            // ... handle event
            injectSectet(event)
            tsMap.Store()
        case watch.Deleted:
            // ... handle event
            tsMap.Delete()
    }
}
```


Send data from deviceShifu to telemetryService, like
```go
type TelemetryRequest struct {
	RawData              []byte `json:"rawData,omitempty"`
    TelemetryServiceName string `json:"Name,omitempty"`
}
```


telemetryService HTTP Server like
```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("/", TelemetryRequestHandler)
err := Start(stop, mux, serverListenPort)
```
```go
func TelemetryRequestHandler() {
    connectionSetting,exists := tsMap.Load(TelemetryRequest.TelemetryServiceName)
    if !exists {
        return
    }
    if connectionSetting.SQLSetting != nil {}
    if connectionSetting.MQTTSetting != nil {}
    if connectionSetting.MinIOSetting != nil {}
}
```

pushSetting in deviceShifu's Configmap
```yaml
...
  pushSettings:
    telemetryCollectionService: push-endpoint-1
...
```
